The provider quota widget no longer disappears when a quota window resets.
Previously, a reset that happened while you were away — such as the weekly limit
rolling over overnight — hid the `5h` and `7d` gauges entirely until your next
agent turn.

A window past its reset time now stays visible with unknown usage (`—`) until
the provider reports the new period. A reset that falls inside the status cache
lifetime no longer leaves the previous period's percentage on screen or claims
unconfirmed headroom.
