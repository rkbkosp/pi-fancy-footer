Provider quota reset countdowns now appear only when a window reaches 75% usage
by default, keeping low-usage windows compact.

Set the threshold in the **Provider Status** widget settings or in
`fancy-footer.json`:

```json
{
  "providerStatus": {
    "resetMinUsedPercent": 80
  }
}
```

Set `resetMinUsedPercent` to `0` to restore the previous behavior and show every
eligible countdown.
